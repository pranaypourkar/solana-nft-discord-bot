pollingInterval = 2000; // ms
Polling interval for how often we want our bot to check for new sales. I recommend setting this to be somewhere between 2000–5000ms at least. This is because the default Solana RPC nodes have rate-limits and your requests won’t go through if you’re making too many calls in a short time period. You can use an RPC provider like GenesysGo to make unlimited calls, though this won’t be free
